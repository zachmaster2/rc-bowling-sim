# RC Bowling Simulator

A phone web page for trying out the controls of a remote-controlled bowling ball: a first-person view of a regulation lane on the top of the screen and a virtual thumb stick on the bottom.

**Open it on a phone, held upright:** https://zachmaster2.github.io/rc-bowling-sim/

## How to drive

1. Put a thumb anywhere on the bottom panel and push up. The ball travels in the direction the stick points, straight up being straight down the lane; how far you push sets how hard the ball pushes.
2. You stand at the back of the approach and walk up behind the ball as far as the foul line.
3. After each ball a card shows where it hit, the entry angle, the speed, and what published USBC data says a hit like that strikes.
4. **Reset** puts the same ball back at its start at any time.

The gear button opens the settings: control scheme, the stick's response curve, sensing errors, the start board and distance, walking up, the shot log, and **Turn the controller with the phone**. With that on, turning the phone turns the controller's pointing direction and **Recenter** sets "straight down the lane" to where the phone points now (allow motion access when asked).

## Notes

- The lane, its markings and the pins are drawn to regulation dimensions, seen from the eye height of a 5 ft 9 in driver standing behind the approach.
- The pins fall by rigid-body physics that is not validated for pin carry. The percentage on the result card comes from a published USBC chart (Stremmel, "Entry Angle", Fig. 1) and is the better guide.
- Turning with the phone is off by default. When it is on, motion sensors need a secure (https) page and, on an iPhone, a tap to allow them; without them (a desktop browser, for instance) a drag strip above the stick and the arrow keys turn the controller.
- It is one file, `index.html`, loading three.js r128 and cannon.js 0.6.2 from cdnjs.
